# Spatial Frame Network
### Introduction
- A traditional Spatial Frequency Extraction is using (dilated convolutions=atrous convolutions) and downsampling. Now we have SFEGO that can do Spatial Frequency Extraction in real-time such that we can using SFEGO to extend the channel count with spatial frame.

- Now we already write a PyOpenCL version of SFEGO: https://github.com/CardLin/SFEGO_PyOpenCL

### Implement
- python SFEGO_LIB.py dog.528.jpg
